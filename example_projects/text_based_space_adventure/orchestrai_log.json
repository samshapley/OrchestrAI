The game will run in the terminal and present the player with situations and choices at each step, with the choices determining the path of the story. \n\nThe game will have a linear storyline, but with multiple branches based on the player's choices. The story will revolve around a character who is a space explorer, navigating through the space, encountering different planets, aliens and situations. \n\nThe player will input their choices via number selections or keywords in the terminal, with the program then reacting to these inputs and progressing the story accordingly.\n\n**Core Objectives:**\n\n1. Generate a story framework with multiple user-selected paths.\n2. Create an engaging and immersive space adventure narrative.\n3. Implement user input to guide story progression.\n\n**PROGRAM FEATURES:**\n\n1. Text-based storytelling: The game will tell its story through text prompts in the terminal.\n\n2. User Input: The user will input their choices via the terminal. They will be given a set of options at each decision point, and their choice will determine the next course of action.\n\n3.

Hard code the full adventure in the python so it is played in the terminal. Make it about space.\nCODE_PLAN: **PROGRAM SPECIFICATION**\n\n**Program Description:**\n\nThe program will be a text-based adventure game set in space. The game will run in the terminal and present the player with situations and choices at each step, with the choices determining the path of the story. \n\nThe game will have a linear storyline, but with multiple branches based on the player's choices. The story will revolve around a character who is a space explorer, navigating through the space, encountering different planets, aliens and situations. \n\nThe player will input their choices via number selections or keywords in the terminal, with the program then reacting to these inputs and progressing the story accordingly.\n\n**Core Objectives:**\n\n1. Generate a story framework with multiple user-selected paths.\n2. Create an engaging and immersive space adventure narrative.\n3. Implement user input to guide story progression.\n\n**PROGRAM FEATURES:**\n\n1. Text-based storytelling: The game will tell its story through text prompts in the terminal.\n\n2. User Input: The user will input their choices via the terminal. They will be given a set of options at each decision point, and their choice will determine the next course of action.\n\n3. Different Pathways: Depending on the decisions the user makes, they will be led down different story paths. Some decisions may lead to 'game over' situations, while others will progress the story. \n\n4. ASCII Art: To add to the immersion and visual appeal, the program might include ASCII art representing different aspects of the story like the spaceship, aliens, planets etc.\n\n**Program Structure & Classes:**\n\nThe program will consist of several scripts, primarily:\n\n1. main.py - The entry point to the program. It will handle the running of the game loop and user input.\n\n2. story.py - This script will handle the story elements of the game. It will contain the story text and path progressions.\n\n3. visuals.py - This script will contain ASCII visual elements of the game.\n\n**Core Classes and Functions:**\n\n+ class Game in main.py\n\n   - `start_game(self)`: Starts the game and prints the introduction.\n   - `game_loop(self)`: Handles the main game loop, continually accepting user input and advancing the story based on user decisions.\n\n+ class Story in story.py\n\n   - `__init__(self)`: Constructor for the story, sets up the story framework.\n   - `get_current_scene(self)`: Returns the current scene based on the story progression.\n   - `next_scene(self, decision)`: Uses the user's decision to determine the next scene.\n\n+ class Visuals in visuals.py\n\n   - `__init__(self)`: Constructor for the visual elements.\n   - `render(self, element)`: Renders the ASCII art for the given element.\n\nThe user will run the game by running main.py.\n\nThis specification provides a comprehensive description of the intended program, ensuring that the developer has a clear understanding of what needs to be built, and how the different components will interact with each other.", "max_tokens": null, "top_p": 1, "temperature": 0.8, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}, "action_timestamp": 1693689995324}, {"module": "modify_codebase", "input": "WORKING_CODEBASE: ----story.py----\nclass Story: def __init__(self): self.current_scene = 'intro' self.game_over = False self.scenes = { 'intro': { 'description': 'You are in your spaceship, ready to launch.

The game lets players embark on a journey through space, making choices that affect the outcome of their adventure. The player starts in a spaceship ready to launch and makes decisions to interact with aliens, fight back, or escape from danger. The choices made by the player determine the progress of the game.\n\nThe codebase is made up of two Python files:\n\n- `story.py` contains the `Story` class, which holds the game logic and the different scenes. \n- `main.py` contains the `Game` class, which is responsible for starting the game and handling the game loop.\n\n## How to use\n\n1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). This codebase was built using Python 3, and might not work correctly with Python 2.\n\n2. Clone this repository to your local machine.\n\n3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.\n\n4. Run the game using the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n5. The game will start, presenting you with a situation and a list of options. Enter the number corresponding to your chosen option and press enter.\n\n6. The game will progress based on your choices. Some choices may lead to the end of the game. If the game ends, you may restart it by running the command from step 4 again.\n\n## Code Structure\n\n### Story Class\n\nThe `Story` class contains the main logic for the game. It maintains the current scene, whether the game has ended, and a dictionary of possible scenes.\n\nEach scene is a dictionary containing a description and a list of possible options. The `get_current_scene` method returns the current scene, and the `next_scene` method updates the current scene based on the player's decision.\n\n### Game Class\n\nThe `Game` class initializes a `Story` object and starts the game. It contains the `game_loop` method, which continues to present the player with the current scene and options until the game ends.\n\nThe ASCII art represents the spaceship and the game over scene. The `game_loop` method handles user input, prompting the player to enter a valid decision if the entered decision is not valid.\n\nHappy adventuring!", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a module in OrchestrAI, a framework chaining together LLMs to build large scale autonomous systems.
