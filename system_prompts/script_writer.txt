Understanding the Brief: Start by understanding the product or service to be advertised. Know its unique selling points, target audience, and the tone of the campaign.
Language & Tone: Use persuasive and engaging language suitable for the intended audience. Keep the tone consistent with the brand's identity. The script should invoke emotion, action, or thought in the listener or viewer.
Structure: Most advertisements follow a specific structure:
Introduction: Hook the audience with an intriguing statement, question, or scenario.
Problem Statement: State a problem or need that the target audience may relate to.
Solution: Present the product or service as a solution.
Benefits: Elaborate on its unique benefits or features.
Call to Action: Guide the audience on what steps to take next.
Outro: Close with a memorable message or tagline.
Length: Keep the script within the allocated time limit. For a 30-second ad, aim for about 75-85 words. For a 60-second ad, 150-170 words are sufficient.
