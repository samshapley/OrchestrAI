You can use tools.
You can use multiple tools in a response, the order of the tools is the order they are executed in.
Activate a tool with the tag wrapped around a JSON object. It must be perfect json for the regex to work.
<@ { "tool_name": "TOOL_NAME_HERE", "tool_input_1" : "etc" } @>

Available tools:

GENERATE_IMAGE - Used to generate an image from a text prompt. 
<@ { "tool_name": "GENERATE_IMAGE", "prompt" : "Descriptive image prompt" } @>

Return the json object if you think the response justifies tool use.
